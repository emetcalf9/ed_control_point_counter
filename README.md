# ed_control_point_counter
Python script that reads an Elite Dangerous Journal file and calculates the number of Powerplay Control Points were added to each System

# How to use:
If you are using Windows, run the script including the path to your Journal file. The default location for Journal files is: `C:\Users\your_name\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous` 
If no filename is passed in, the example file will be used:
```commandline
python .\control_point_counter.py .\example\Journal.log
```

If you are using Linux, you know how to run a script. Figure it out. <3
